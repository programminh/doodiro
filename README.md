# Doodiro
[Doodle's](http://www.doodle.com) copy made for a class at Universite de Montreal (IFT3225 - Technologies de l'internet)

Written in PHP using a "frameworkless" environment.

This web application had to be backward compatible with PHP5.0.2, hence the non-native JSON decode/encode as well as the poorly written/security-free SQL functions.
